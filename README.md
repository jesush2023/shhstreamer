### Context:
Hi guys, my name is 

<img width="663" height="241" alt="ascii-art-text" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dce75778-0cdb-4f4e-a105-465debdc7b26" />

or "iMist" (idk, i was bored lol.) and I made this silly thing bcs
I got to shy an nervous on stream, also my english is kinda broken since I'm a non native speaker
and yeah, I'm still learning code, I had a lot of fun testing and making this, I know it's a small program.

I'm plannig to do streams coding while I learn and start a YT Channel soon!  so, stay tuned for more!

(◞‸◟；) I'm still a newbie.

# Getting Started

### Requirements. 
- ~~NASA PC~~ 
- Have Edge or Chrome installed
- Install VB-CABLE (you'll need it for further config.)
    Link: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
- Download Release on Releases extract it and Go setting up VC
### Setting up (Virtual Cable) (Need testing)
- After installation Restart your PC.
- On windows (sry linux, someday.) go to your sound settings -> App volume and preferences (located a the bottom)
- find 'python.exe' (or 'main_eel.exe') in the list.
- Change the **Ouput** device from "Default" to **"CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)"**.

### Setting up OBS / Discord Configuration
- **In OBS:** Add a new source for "Audio Output Capture" and select **"CABLE Input"** (This captures the audio the bot is sending).
- **In Discord:** In Voice & Video settings, change the input device to **"CABLE Output"** (The cable's output device acts as the bot's microphone).

### Setting up This.
- Just plug and play it, extract it and double click after setting up VC
